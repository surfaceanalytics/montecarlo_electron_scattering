    """The Scatterer class represents the scattering medium.
    
    A scattering medium is some atoms, of a particular element, 
    with a specified density. The scattering medium can elastically scatter or 
    inelastically scatter an electron. Both processes are defined by the 
    elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections.
    The elastic and inelastic scattering processes each have scattering angle 
    distributions. These are probablity distribution functions that generate
    random angles according to the chosen AngleDist class.
