class Simulation():
    """The simulation class is for running a Monte Carlo simulation of 
    many electrons travelling through a scattering medium. The simulation
    is run inside a 3D volume, called the Boundary (it is a sphere). 
    The scattering medium, and the source of the electrons is a volume
    called the Source (it is a cylinder at the center of the Boundary).
    Electrons are generated at random positions within the Source. They 
    have an initial kinetic energy, and are given a random initial 
    direction. A distance is randomly chosen from an exponential 
    distribution, which is defined by the Total Cross Section (total_xsect).
    Electrons can experience two kinds of scattering event: 1. elastic 
    and 2. inelastic scattering. Both elastic and inelastic processes have
    their own corss sections. The total cross section is the sum of elastic
    and inelastic. After choosing a random distance from the exponential
    distribtuion, it is randomly chosen whether the collision is elastic
    or inelastic (this is based on the relative cross sections of the two
    processes). Then, depending on the scatteing type, a random angle is
    chosen from an angular spread distribution. Based on the chosen angle,
    a new velocity is calculated (note: if inelastic scttering, the kinetic
    energy decreases each event). 
    The electron's new position is determined from the random distance 
    divided by the previous velocity. If the new position is inside the 
    volume of the source, then the move is accepted. The position and 
    velocity are updated. A counter for number of times elastically
    or inelastically scattered is incremented.
    If the electron's new position is outside of the Source, then the move 
    is rejected, and the electron is projected onto the Boundary by
    extending its prevous velocity to the Boundary.
    When an electron hts the boundary, its simulation is over, and the
    simultation moves on to calculate the next electron. If the electron
    does not intersect the Boundary ofter a user defined number of
    inelastic scattering events, then the simulation of the electon is over
    and the simulation moves to a new electron.
    This process is repeated for as many electrons as desired.
